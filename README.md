# HeartDiseasePrediction
The project is based on the 'Heart  Disease prediction system' which aims to predict whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with heart disease or not using the medical history of the patient utilizing machine learning models.

In this Machine Learning project, we have loaded the dataset into a Jupyter notebook, pre-processed the data, checked for outliers, and trained the model using Support Vector Classifier and Naive Bayes Classifiers. Then we check the accuracy of each classification model and use the best one for further predictions.

Then we created a user interface (website) using HTML and CSS which contains interactive pages including the Home page and the About page.

The Home page has a button named 'Check Your Heart' which will then lead to a form that will consist of all the features we have used in our dataset to predict the occurrence of heart disease. The user will fill out the form according to the instructions mentioned and then click on the 'Predict' button which will then open a page that will mention if the person has heart disease or not. 
The Predict button predicts the heart disease using the Machine Learning model and the connectivity of the same is done by Flask in Python.

The About page consists of instructions for the user to fill up the values which will then be used to predict the future occurrence of heart disease using the Machine Learning model
